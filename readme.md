## DEATH ON A JET PACK
in a garden...

#### death GROWS A GARDEN on a jetpack....

Not finished :(

First it is not finished.

Second packaging into a working game is also not working. kontra + esbuild is screwing something up but I am not getting errors for it.

## To make the final esbuild

`node build.js`

Then copy game.dist.js into the directory final.

That should be it.... but no errors for me and it does not work.

## to make the final.zip file

use make
